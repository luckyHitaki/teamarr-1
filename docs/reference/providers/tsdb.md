# TheSportsDB Provider

TheSportsDB (TSDB) is a community-driven sports data API. Teamarr uses it as a fallback provider (priority 100) for leagues not covered by ESPN, including Australian sports, rugby, cricket, boxing, CFL, and Scandinavian leagues.

## API Details

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base URL** | `https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/{api_key}/{endpoint}` |
| **Auth** | API key in URL path (`123` for free tier) |
| **Priority** | 100 (last resort) |
| **Rate Limit** | 30 req/min free, 100 req/min premium |

## API Tiers

| | Free | Premium |
|---|---|---|
| **API Key** | `123` (default) | Your own key (6+ digits) |
| **Rate Limit** | 30 req/min | 100 req/min |
| **Events per Query** | 5 per day per league | Full coverage |
| **Team Search** | 10 teams | 3,000 teams |
| **Cost** | Free | ~$9/month |

### Free Tier Leagues

These leagues have low enough event volume to work within free tier limits:

- CFL, Unrivaled, Norwegian Hockey, Boxing

### Premium Tier Leagues

These leagues have high event volume or unreliable free-tier data and require a premium key for full coverage:

- AFL, NRL, Super Rugby (Australian/rugby)
- IPL, BBL, SA20 (cricket)
- Svenska Cupen (soccer)

The `tsdb_tier` column in `schema.sql` classifies each league as `free` or `premium`.

## Configuration

Add your premium key in **Settings > System > TheSportsDB API Key**. The key takes effect immediately (no restart required). The league picker shows a crown icon on premium-tier leagues and warns if you select one without a key configured.

## Supported Leagues

## Event Resolution

TSDB uses a three-step fallback chain when fetching events:

1. **`eventsday.php`** — date-specific lookup (primary, works for most leagues)
2. **`eventsnextleague.php`** — upcoming events filtered by date (fallback)
3. **`eventsround.php`** — full round/season events filtered by date (last resort, used for leagues like Unrivaled)

## Rate Limiting

Teamarr enforces rate limits **preemptively** using a sliding window limiter — it tracks request timestamps and waits before approaching the limit, rather than waiting for 429 responses.

If the API does return HTTP 429, Teamarr retries with exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 80s).

Rate limit statistics (total requests, preemptive waits, reactive waits) are tracked and available for UI feedback.

## TSDB League Configuration

Each TSDB league requires **two** identifiers in `schema.sql`:

| Column | Used By | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `provider_league_id` | `eventsnextleague.php`, `lookupleague.php` | `5159` |
| `provider_league_name` | `eventsday.php`, `search_all_teams.php` | `Canadian OHL` |

These must match TSDB's internal data exactly. Use `search_all_leagues.php` to discover correct values.

## Cache TTLs

| Data | TTL |
|------|-----|
| Teams | 24 hours |
| Next events | 1 hour |
| Past games | 7 days |
| Today's games | 30 minutes |
| Tomorrow's games | 4 hours |
| 3-7 days out | 8 hours |
| 8+ days out | 24 hours |

## Season Type Normalization

TSDB has no dedicated playoff/season-type field, but TheSportsDB's API convention assigns special `intRound` values to knockout stages. The provider maps these to canonical `postseason`:

| `intRound` | Canonical | Stage |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `125` | `postseason` | Quarter-Final (also used for NBA Conference Semi-Finals in some leagues) |
| `150` | `postseason` | Semi-Final / Conference Finals |
| `160` | `postseason` | First Round / Play-in |
| `170` | `postseason` | Playoff Semi-Final (e.g. NBA Conference Semis) |
| `180` | `postseason` | Playoff Final (e.g. NBA Conference Finals) |
| `200` | `postseason` | Final / Championship |

Verified on 2026-04-22 against NBA 2024 Playoffs, NHL 2024 Stanley Cup Final, and IPL 2024 playoffs — all use these codes. UCL knockouts, international tournaments, and other cup competitions also use them.

**Known gap:** Not every TSDB league opts into the special codes. AFL and NRL keep simple round numbering through finals (AFL Grand Final → `intRound=19`; NRL Grand Final → `intRound=24`), so we can't distinguish their postseason from regular season. For those leagues `{season_type}` returns empty. Adding per-league heuristics (e.g. "NRL round 27+ is finals") would be fragile and unmaintainable — the provider deliberately returns `None` rather than `regular` for non-postseason events so the gap is detectable.

Preseason is not detected for any TSDB league — there's no corresponding convention.

Other season-adjacent fields (`strSeason` year string, `strGroup`) don't help. Premium tier doesn't expose additional playoff signals — it only unlocks higher rate limits, livescores, highlights, and full team schedules (verified across `lookupevent.php`, `eventsseason.php`, `eventsnextleague.php`, `search_all_seasons.php`, `lookupleague.php`).
